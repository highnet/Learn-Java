# Learn-Java

A comprehensive collection of Java projects and algorithms, ranging from classic data structures to interactive games and simulations. This repository is designed for learning, experimentation, and demonstration of Java programming concepts.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a variety of Java projects, each located in its own subdirectory under `src/`. Below is a summary of the main projects:

### Project Summaries

- **AfricaRender**: Tools and data for rendering and analyzing Africa map data.
- **AlgoDat2021**: Algorithm and data structure exercises, organized by problem set.
- **ArchaeologyRS**: A simulation and database for managing archaeological materials and hotspots, inspired by RuneScape's Archaeology skill.
- **Basics**: A collection of beginner-friendly Java programs, including:
  - Bike Courier Service Simulator: Simulates courier deliveries between districts.
  - Bracket Parser (stack): Checks for balanced brackets in expressions.
  - Guessing Game: Simple number guessing game with limited attempts.
  - And more (factorial, digit sum, matrix transposer, etc.).
- **CharTree**: Implementation and demonstration of a binary tree for characters, with search and traversal features.
- **Checkers**: A graphical checkers game with a custom game engine and user interface.
- **Dice**: A graphical dice rolling simulator.
- **DoublyLinked-DoubleEnded-IntList**: Implementation of a doubly linked, double-ended integer list (deque) with add/remove operations.
- **Game**: Framework and data for various game-related experiments.
- **GearWorks2WayChat**: GUI-based two-way chat application with networking support.
- **GearWorksGame**: A 2D game engine and demo with crafting, inventory, and player/NPC systems.
- **gToonsRemake**: Remake of the gToons card game, featuring a graphical interface and game logic.
- **IntTree**: Integer binary tree implementation with add, search, and comparison features.
- **JavaTree**: Graph and tree data structure implementation with breadth-first search and vertex/edge management.
- **Map**: Custom map data structure (`JMap`) with generic key-value support.
- **MapList**: Generic linked list implementation for use in other data structures.
- **Raspberry-Pi**: Raspberry Pi-related Java experiments and code.
- **Recursive**: Examples of recursive algorithms, including factorial and prime checking.
- **Risk**: A graphical Risk board game implementation with map and game engine.
- **RiskCoordinateMapGenerator**: Tools for generating and visualizing Risk game maps.
- **rpg**: RPG-related code and experiments.
- **Singly-Linked-List**: Implementation and demonstration of a singly linked integer list with recursive and iterative methods.
- **SnakeGUI**: A graphical snake/tracer game.
- **Swing-Draw-Arrow-function**: Utility for drawing arrows in Java Swing applications.
- **TicTacToe**: A graphical TicTacToe game with user interface and game logic.
